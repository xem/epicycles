===========
Epic Cycles
===========

This demo shows the JS1K logo drawn by 64 interconnected gears.

Golfed with <3 by BalintCsala and xem
Thanks to romancortes, eljj, antimatter15, brettcvz, Paul Bourke, and kuvos for their help, individual work and ideas!

The user can:
- click (and move) to add points.
- press up and down arrows to change the number of gears.
- press left to show or hide intermediate gears' paths.
- press right to clear the scene and start a new epicycloid.

All the paths are considered closed: the epicycloid will loop through all the points in the order in which they were clicked.

// m : mouse down flag.
m = 0;

// On mouse down: set m.
onmousedown = e => m = 1;

// On mouse move: if the mouse is down, recompute the epicycloid with the current mouse coordinates.
onmousemove = e => m && f(e);

// On mouse up: recompute the epicycloid with the current mouse coordinates and unset m.
onmouseup = e => (m = 0, f(e));

// When an arrow key is pressed, one of these four functions is called:
onkeydown = e => [

  // Left arrow (keyCode 37): toggle D (the multiple path flag).
  e => D ^= 1,
  
  // Up arrow (keyCode 38): increase Q (the max number of gears to draw).
  e => Q++,
  
  // Right arrow (keyCode 39): clear p (the points coordinates), G (the gears), and recompute the epicycloid (to reset everything else).
  e => (p = [], G = [], f()),
  
  // Down arrow (keyCode 40): decrease Q.
  e => Q--

// Execute the function stored at the index e.which - 37 (same as e.keyCode - 37).
][e.which - 37]();

// p is a 2D array representing the X and Y coordinates of each point.
p = [];

// By default (on load), a pattern representing JS1K is drawn. 
// This pattern is made of 33 points:

/*
p = [
 [0,0], [1,0], [1,3], [0,3], [0,2], [0,3], [1,3], [1,0], // J
 [4,0], [2,0], [2,1], [4,2], [4,3], [2,3], // S
 [5,3], [5,0], [4,1], [5,0], [5,3], [6,3], // 1
 [6,0], [6,2], [7,1], [6,2], [7,3], [6,2], [6,3], // K
 [4,3], [4,2], [2,1], [2,0], [2,0], [2,0] // Return at the beginning
]
*/

// The last point is repeated 3 times to trigger the next "power of two" number of gears (64 instead of 32), for extra precision.
// Each pair of coordinates were encoded in an ASCII char in the form "0b10xxxyy" (3 bits for X, 2 bits for Y).
// The code below decodes X and Y from each character of the string "@DGCBCGDPHIRSKWTQTW[XZ]Z_Z[SRIHHH" and adds a multiplier and an offset to have a correct sizing and centering.

  // It stops when P has a length that is equal to a power of two.
  // This "power of two" size would be mandatory if we computed a FFT of all the points,
  // but to save bytes in this demo, we only compute a standard DFT. So this padding is finally only used only to add a nicer precision to the drawings.
